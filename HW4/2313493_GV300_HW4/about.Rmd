## About Me

I'm **Sumer Gupta**, a student at the **University of Essex** specializing in quantitative methods in government and political analysis. My research interests lie at the intersection of data science and political science, with a focus on:

-   Electoral behavior and voting patterns

-   Causal inference and experimental design

-   Data-driven policy analysis

-   Democratic representation and political inequality

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Education

**University of Essex** *, Colchester, United Kingdom*.

**Courses**:

(1) GV207 - Quantitative Political Analysis

(2) GV300 - Advanced Quantitative Political Analysis

**Focus Areas:**

-   Statistical analysis using R

-   Regression analysis and modeling

-   Experimental design

-   Data visualization and communication

-   Causal inference

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Skills

### Programming Languages

-   R - Primary language for statistical analysis

-   RMarkdown - Reproducible research and reporting

-   LaTeX - Creating high-quality and professional documents

### R Packages and Libraries

## About this Website

This portfolio was made using [Distill for R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and [Postcards](https://github.com/seankross/postcards). **All analyses are fully reproducible** - every visualization, statistic and table is directly generated from source code, ensuring transparency and reproducability.
